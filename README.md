# roll-game

## Introduction

> My final year project of the BSc Games Programming degree at Goldsmiths, University of London. Roll is a unique and immersive experience which aims to offer a fresh perspective on how we interact with the video games that we play. I believe that the current set of game controllers are quite static and rigid in that you only need to move your fingers to control player movement and interaction. Roll aims to do just this by combining classic components of a video game with the incredible science of physical computing. By infusing the two, Roll aspires to bridge the gap between playing on a digital screen with the analog world to create a more fulfilling and immersive game experience. The goal is to guide a sphere to the end of different levels, avoiding traps, solving mechanics and carefully not falling down crazy platforms; are you ready to feel heat on your hands while rolling a 400mm physical sphere and get splashed by water?
